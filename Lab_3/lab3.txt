### How is the TCP connection established between the client and server? How does the server handle incoming connections?

The TCP connection between the client and server is established when the client initiates a connection request to the server's IP and port. Upon receiving this request, the server acknowledges it, creating a TCP handshake, which involves three steps: SYN (synchronize), SYN-ACK (synchronize acknowledgment), and ACK (acknowledgment). This process establishes a reliable connection for data exchange between the client and server. In the activities, the server listens on a specified port using `net.Listen` in Go, allowing it to continuously accept incoming client connections. For each connection, the server creates a `net.Conn` object, which facilitates reading and writing data between the client and server.

### What challenge does the server face when handling multiple clients, and how does Go’s concurrency model help solve this problem?

When handling multiple clients, the server must manage several connections simultaneously. A traditional synchronous server would process each client request one by one, which can lead to delays or even make the server unresponsive if multiple clients are connected. Go's concurrency model solves this problem efficiently with goroutines, lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. Each client connection is handled in its own goroutine, allowing the server to process requests from multiple clients concurrently without blocking. For instance, when a client connects, the server initiates a goroutine using `go handleClient(conn)` to handle the client independently. This enables the server to handle many clients concurrently, optimizing resource utilization and responsiveness.

### How does the server assign tasks to the clients? What real-world distributed systems scenario does this model resemble?

In the task processing example, the server generates a task (a random number) and sends it to each connected client. The clients receive the task, process it (square the number in this case), and send the result back to the server. This server-client interaction resembles a master-worker (or master-slave) architecture commonly seen in distributed systems like distributed computing clusters. In such a model, a central server (master) assigns tasks to worker nodes (clients), which perform computations or process data and then return results to the master. Real-world examples include distributed task queues (like Celery) and computing frameworks (like Apache Hadoop’s MapReduce), where tasks are delegated to worker nodes for parallel processing.
